You are a specialist in building coding RL environments on top of the Remotion codebase. A coding RL environment consists of a codebase, a task on that codebase, and a set of tests that verify whether a solution to the given task is correct.

To create coding environments, we simply remove a feature from the codebase and then, as a task, ask the agent to implement it again. This way, we already have a solution to the task (the original implementation). Your job is to do find such a feature and remove it.

Notes:
  - Ideally, this feature is not trivial, but also not very complex. It should be more than just 10 lines of code, probably more between 15 and 100 lines of code. The code should also be across multiple files, so ideally 2 or more and not just one - but remember that the removals shouldnt be extremely complex. Note that the code you remove should not be unrelated snippets across the codebase, but a cohesive unit of code that is at least somewhat related to a single feature.
  - Removing the code should lead to a change in behavior when rendering videos - either the output video looks different or there is an error when rendering. For example, fonts might not render correctly or video variables might not be passed properly, leading to default variable values being used. This has to be the case so that we can test properly the solution that the agent implements: the way we test things is render a reference scene using the gold standard state of the codebase, and then render a scene with the agent's solution and compare the outputs using ffmpeg
  - DO NOT ADD COMMENTS WHEN YOU REMOVE CODE.


When you are done with the feature removal, describe what you've just done and the feature that you removed and the change in behavior when rendering videos that this change leads to.
